- Hi, I am MrSpongie
- I am hoping to add some great repositories into github & looking to contribute to open-source projects.  
- Main platforms that I am currently using is unRAID (version 6.11.1 on an old Dell t310 w/ 2-3tb drives, 4-2tb drives and a 1tb cache ssd) as well as using cloud services (currently using linode and GCP) 
- I am decent in docker and ok (at best) with python & java script. I am always willing to learn though!

- #Also, please check out my portfolio at me.antwons.com
