- Hi, I am MrSpongie
- I am hoping to add some great repositories into github & looking to contribute to open-source projects.  
- Main platforms that I am currently using is unRAID (version 6.11.5 on an old Dell t310 w/ 2-3tb drives, 4-2tb drives and a 1tb cache ssd), 2 Raspberry Pi 4b's running raspbian os lite, as well as using cloud services (currently using linode, AWS and GCP) 
- I am decent in docker and ok (at best) with python & java script. I am always willing to learn though! 
- Please check out my knowledge base on some docker containers my friends and I run at https://portal.antwons.com
- #Also, please check out my portfolio at me.antwons.com
