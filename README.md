*What is this?* 
> Well, this is my Github profile! Here I will post several projects that I am working at for work, school and home. If you see any projects that you like, feel free to check them out. Just don't forget to star them!

*What do you do for a living?*
> I work in the I.T. industry, as a Site-Tech for my local school district. It's one of the most rewarding jobs I have ever had & the first I.T. job for me!

*What are some of your hobbies?* 
> As you can tell, Home-Labs are a huge passion of mine! I love creating things, documenting what I did & sharing them with people just like you! I started getting into this hobby because of my best friends Josh & Ryan and their love for technology & solving problems. The least I can do to repay them for the love they gave me is by documenting everything I am learning, deploying and breaking to pay it forward to the rest of you!

*Where can we see more of your projects?*
> Coming soon there will be a list of projects here that you can click on and explore. These lists are publically available to showcase what I do!
